I have mostly been using junit for writing Java unit tests but lately took a quick look at TestNG.

I created a IBAN validator class.

The following test is the accompanying TestNG test.

The dataproviders (correctNumbers and incorrectNumbers) hold an array of correct and incorrect IBAN numbers. These get passed into the validateCorrectNumbers and validateIcorrectNumbers test methods.
