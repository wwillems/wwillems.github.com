This is my first encounter with Java 8's lambdas. To use a lambda I created a functional interface. Conceptually, a functional interface has exactly one abstract method.

I then created a Test class that uses an anonymous class as well as a lambda expression to achieve the same result (printing out the function invocation).

<script src="https://gist.github.com/wwillems/c7e4842628118e5687d2.js"></script>

The resulting output will be:

Function invoked using Anonymous class

Function invoked using Lambda expression
